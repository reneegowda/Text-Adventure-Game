# Text-Adventure-Game
Welcome to Island Odyssey, a thrilling text-based adventure game where you race against the clock to uncover a hidden artifact on a mysterious island. You have 60 seconds to navigate through jungles, caves, and ancient ruins to find the chalice before evil forces do.

Features:

Timed Adventure: You have only 60 seconds to find the artifact. If the time runs out, it's game over!

Interactive Exploration: Choose your path as you explore different locations on the island (caves, jungle, or ruins). Your decisions impact the game's progression.

Branching Storylines: The story branches into multiple paths, leading to different encounters based on your choices. Each location presents unique challenges.

Real-Time Gameplay: The game uses time-based mechanics to add urgency to the exploration. Pauses between text outputs enhance the immersive experience.

Replayability: Multiple ways to navigate the island and discover the artifact make the game replayable, with different outcomes depending on your decisions.

Gameplay:

Start your journey: Choose between three locations—caves, jungle, or ruins—to begin your adventure.

Make choices: Each location offers different options for exploration, leading you further into the story.

Race against time: Keep an eye on the clock. Every decision counts, and the game ends when the timer runs out.

Find the chalice: If you manage to find the magical chalice within the time limit, you win!

Game Flow:

The game starts with an introduction to the island and its mysteries.

You then choose your first location, and from there, you’ll be presented with different options to explore.

Depending on your choices, the game will branch into different paths, with new challenges at each stop.

If you run out of time before finding the chalice, you lose the game.
